Forked from @jeroenbellen [github](https://github.com/jeroenbellen/blog-manage-and-reload-spring-properties)

Original projects shows how to configure standalone configuration server with spring spring-cloud which uses git as config source using spring boot 1.4.0

This fork shows how to do the same but with native file system support on spring-boot 1.5.6 (nothing changed, really) and also add module with embedded config server example.
